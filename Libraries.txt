/1/ <unistd.h>:

- read (int filedescriptor, void *buf, size_t numbyte) from unistd.h, returning number of read bytes

//-----------------


/2/ <termios.h> (library for working with terminal):

- struct termios is structure, that contains current attributes of terminal
	.c_lflag is field for local flags
	.c_iflag -------------input------
	.c_oflag--------------output-----
	.c_cflag--------------control----

- tcgetattr() is function for reading current attributres into a struct

- tcsetattr() is function for wrinting new terminal attributes back
	TCSAFLUSH argument specifies when to apply the change: in this case, it waits for all pending
	output to be written to the terminal, and also discards any input that hasn’t been read.

- ECHO flag allow us to turn off/on echo. So if it turned off we won't see what we are entering

- ICANON flag allow us to turn on/off canonical mode. So if it turned off we will be reading input
	byte-by-byte, instead of line-by-line.

- ISIG flag allow us to turn off/on CTRL-C and CTRL-Z signals (they are terminating or suspending
	processes)

- IEXTEN flag allow us to turn off/on CTRL-V signal (and CTRL_O on macOS). On some systems, when you
	type Ctrl-V, the terminal waits for you to type another character and then sends that character
	literally. For example, before we disabled Ctrl-C, you might’ve been able to type Ctrl-V and then
	Ctrl-C to input a 3 byte.

- IXON flag allow us to turn off/on CTRL-S and CTRL-Q signals (Ctrl-S stops data from being
	transmitted to the terminal until you press Ctrl-Q) This originates in the days when you might
	want to pause the transmission of data to let a device like a printer catch up

- ICRNL flag allow us to turn off/on CTRL-M feature. If you'll print CTRL-M and see it's code, that
	will be 10. It turns out that the terminal is helpfully translating any carriage returns 	
	(13, '\r') inputted by the user into newlines (10, '\n'). CR - carriage return, NL - new line.

- OPOST flag allow us to turn off/on output post-processing. It turns out, that the terminal does a
	similar translation on the output side. It translates each newline ("\n") we print into a carriage
	return followed by a newline ("\r\n"). POST stands for post-processing. After turning its off, you
	should write \r\n, not only

- BRKINT, INPCK, ISTRIP, and CS8 flags are not very usefull
	- When BRKINT is turned on, a break condition will cause a SIGINT signal to be sent to the program,
	like pressing Ctrl-C.

	- INPCK enables parity checking, which doesn’t seem to apply to modern terminal emulators.

	- ISTRIP causes the 8th bit of each input byte to be stripped, meaning it will set it to 0. This is
	probably already turned off.
	
	- CS8 is not a flag, it is a bit mask with multiple bits, which we set using the bitwise-OR (|)
	operator unlike all the flags we are turning off. It sets the character size (CS) to 8 bits per
	byte. On my system, it’s already set that way.

- The VMIN value sets the minimum number of bytes of input needed before read() can return

- The VTIME value sets the maximum amount of time to wait before read() returns. It is in tenths of a
	second.
//-----------------


/3/ <stdlib.h>

- atexit (DisableRawMode). We use to register our disableRawMode() function to be called
	automatically when the program exits normally, whether it exits by returning from main(), or by
	calling the exit() function.

- exit (). We use to exit the programm with 0 exit status (which indicates that everything is ok) or
	non-zero exit status (that indicates failure)

//-----------------


/4/ <stdio.h>

- perror () is function that check global errno variable and prints descriptive error message for it 
	(and also it prints number of string, the code next to which caused error)

//-----------------


/5/ <ctype.h>

- iscntrl (c) shows us whether character c is control character. Control charactares are nonprintable
	characters with ASCII codes 0-31 and 127 (for example: backspace, delete, esc, ctrl-letter
	combinations...)

//-----------------


/6/ <errno.h>

- errno is global variable, that changes by function in which the error occured

- EAGAIN is possible value of errno. In Cygwin, when read() times out it returns -1 with an errno of
	EAGAIN, instead of just returning 0 like it’s supposed to. To make it work in Cygwin, we won’t
	treat EAGAIN as an error.
